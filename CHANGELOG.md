## [0.0.14] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- Handle ESM-only extension packages that throw `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED` during CJS resolution (#55)
- Make `air start` and `air prepare` discover adapters installed to `~/.air/node_modules/` (#54)
- `air init` uses `github://` URI for roots, consistent with other artifact types (#52)

### Changed
- `air init` includes all officially maintained extensions by default: adapter-claude, provider-github, secrets-env, secrets-file (#53)
- `air init` writes auto-generated `roots.json` to the repo directory instead of `~/.air/` (#52)
- `startSession` checks extension-provided adapters before falling back to registry lookup (#54)
